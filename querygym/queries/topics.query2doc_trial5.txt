Firstly, we would have to identify planets with environments that can support life as we know it, primarily searching for water, an essential component for life. Once a viable planet is found, we would need to create a sustainable living environment. This could be achieved through terraforming, a hypothetical process that involves modifying the planet's atmosphere, temperature, surface topography, or ecology to be similar to those of Earth to make it habitable.  In parallel, advancements in technology would need to be made to facilitate space travel and create infrastructure on such planets. This could include self-sustaining habitats, farming equipment for food production, and systems for water purification and waste management.   Additionally, we would need to invest in scientific research to understand the potential impact on human health and how to mitigate these risks, considering changes in gravity and exposure to cosmic radiation.

This mechanism is primarily exhibited through the daily "Two Minutes Hate" sessions. In these sessions, the citizens of Oceania are rallied together to express their collective hatred towards enemies of the Party, particularly Emmanuel Goldstein, the supposed leader of the opposition. These sessions foster a shared sense of enemy and increase loyalty towards the Party. This unity is further solidified with the constant wartime mentality, where hatred towards foreign enemies brings the community closer together. Hatred, therefore, is cleverly manipulated as a means to control and unify the population under the Party’s rule.
